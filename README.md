Shell script to simulate the W.O.P.R. computer from WarGames

First of all, note that the file installation-wargames.sh does not work how it should
I am still working on it.

This is a simple script intended to simulate the interaction with
the W.O.P.R. computer from the film WarGames.

If you were deranged enough to want to use inetd to have this directly
connectable via a telnet port you could:

a) Call it directly
- Create a wopr user, compile wopr.c into the same directory as wargames.sh
- Add an entry of the following to inetd.conf
  telnet stream tcp nowait wopr /.../wargames.sh

b) Call it from telnetd
- Create a wopr user, compile wopr.c into the same directory as wargames.sh
- Copy /etc/gettytab 'default' to 'wopr', replace im= with lo=/.../wargames.sh
- Add an entry of the following to inetd.conf
  telnet stream tcp nowait wopr /usr/libexec/telnetd telnetd -g wopr -a off -h

The former has the advantage of a telnetd to correctly intepret all the IAC
sequences, but will require some clients to use 'telnet -K' to connect
